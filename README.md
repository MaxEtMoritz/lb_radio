## Project architecture

Project consists of a front-end in plain HTML and JS and a back-End NodeJS Server (mostly due to the fact that most internet radio streams don't implement CORS or don't allow every site).

The Back-End Server's Job is to query the web radio Stream URL for Metadata and deliver what was found to the front-end.

The front-end does everything else: Look up radio stations and their Stream URLs in the RadioBrowser API, process the metadata string from the stream server to split it up into an artist and title part, periodically query the Back-end server for metadata, ...

## Development setup

Prerequisite to the following steps is a working NodeJS setup on your machine.

To start the development on this project, clone this repository to your machine first.

After that, cd into the repository's root directory and install the dependencies by
```console
npm install
```

After that you can modify the source files of the project, [compile it](#compiling-the-project) and [start the server](#running-the-server) to see if the changes you made had the desired effect.

### Compiling the project
The project is using Webpack to bundle the front-end. After modifying the source files, you can compile by running
```console
npm run build
```

### Running the server
To start the NodeJS server, run
```console
npm run serve
```

## Licenses

Licenses of third party packages can be obtained with the help of the NPM package `license-checker` as follows:
